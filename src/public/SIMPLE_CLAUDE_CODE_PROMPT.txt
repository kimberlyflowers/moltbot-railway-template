Deploy the Bloomie Dashboard to Railway. The service already exists at moltbot-railway-template-production-8d5a.up.railway.app on port 8080.

Steps:
1. Initialize git repo and commit all files
2. Create GitHub repo "bloomie-dashboard" and push
3. Connect GitHub repo to existing Railway service "moltbot-railway-template"
4. Set Railway environment variables:
   - DASHBOARD_USERNAME=bloomie
   - DASHBOARD_PASSWORD=bloom2025!
   - PORT=8080
   - NODE_ENV=production
5. Verify deployment at https://moltbot-railway-template-production-8d5a.up.railway.app

The app uses Express with HTTP Basic Auth. All files are ready in the current directory: server.js, package.json, and public/index.html with dashboard.jsx.

Report back with the live URL and confirm authentication is working.
